This is the dataset about algae blooms

Following are the data columns and their meanings:
season: Autumn,spring,summer and winter are the four seasons when the river samples were taken across different european rivers
speed: speed of the river
size: size of the river
mxPH: Maximum pH value of the river
mnO2: Minimum value of O2(oxygen)   
Cl : Mean values of Chloride
NO3: Mean value of Nitrates
NH4: Mean value of ammonium
oPO4: Mean value of orthophosphate
PO4: Mean value of phosphate
Chla: Mean of chlorophyll

Above are the different chemicals found in the river and their values

We also have 7 different types of algaes:
"a1"     "a2"     "a3"     "a4"     "a5"    "a6"     "a7"

From these dataset we want to predict when does the algae blooms considering the above different river and chemical parameters so that water quality and river lifeforms can be protected
